              <h3>Kickstarter is a cultural phenomenon</h3>
              <p>It has changed the world. People who never before had access to funding for their creative projects, ideas that never would have made it past day dreams, even some things that shouldn't have seen the light of day all defied what previous generations thought was possible. Kickstarter is, one of many, cases and points for transformative power of the internet. It demonstrates the possbility that commerce and creativity and fun and play and work can all happen at the same time.</p>
              <p>Kickstarter inspires us. So we made some tools and gathered some data to help the community continue to surprise eachother.</p>
